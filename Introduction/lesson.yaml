  Output: "Welcome to the Introduction to Classification Trees!  This tutorial will 
           introduce the student to the Classification and Regression Trees Methodology (CART)
           introduced by Breiman, Friedman, Olshen, and Stone in 1984.  For more 
           information on CART models and in depth details that will not be covered here, students can refer 
           to the book, 'Classification and Regression Trees' by Breiman and Friedman (1984)."

- Class: text
  Output: "This lesson consists of multiple parts.  First, in this introduction, 
           the CART methodology will be explained including examples of
           common applications.  In the second section, the student will have the opportunity 
           to fit a CART model of their own using data provided.  Third, the features and 
           potential problems of this methodology will be discussed."

        through the questions or type 'bye()' to exit."

  Output: "CART models are prediction models that use a decision tree structure
           to predict a response or target value.  Models with response values that are
           factors or have a finite number of possible responses are called
           classification trees.  Models with continuous responses are referred to as regression trees.  
           This lesson will primarily cover classification trees. For more 
           information on regression trees, see the CART book by Breiman and Friedman."
           
- Class: text
  Output: "First, we begin by examining how a model is 'grown'. For each explanatory
           variable, a splitting point is found that 'best' separates the data into 
           classes by response. The definition for 'best' will be explained in more detail later."  
           
- Class: text
  Output:  "Then the explanatory variable with the 'best' splitting point is chosen and the data 
           is split into two parts.  This first split is called the 'root node.' Nodes are locations
           in the tree where the data is subset according to a specific condition."
           
- Class: text
  Output:  For each resulting node, the process is repeated until there are at most k observations 
           in each terminal node, or some other criteria is reached concerning 
           the 'impurity' of each terminal node."
           
- Class: text
  Output:  "A terminal node is a node that has no 'children' nodes, or no splits or branches 
            beneath it."

  Output: "Now, back to how the tree is grown." 

- Class: figure
  Output: "To determine how each split is made, many different criteria can be used.  
            The document that has opened up explains this, when you are finished 
            reading the explanation.  Press return to move on."

  Output: This concludes the introduction portion of this lesson.  
           In the remaining two sections, you will fit a classification tree model 
           and then explore the benefits and difficulties of this model.
